OMFGDOGS!

1. For this lab, I implemented my text styling in the css file, making it large Helvetica font that is aligned to the lower right side of whatever content it is embedded in (in this case, the Body).  I also set the Body to have the omfgdogs.gif tiled on the background.  In the html file, I embedded the audio player and the "http://www.omfgdogs.com/" in the Body.

2. I collaborated with two fellow COMP 20 students, Gabe Nicholas and Joe Wat.

3. Approximately 2 hours (it took longer to get Github working for me, but the actual assignment was between 1 and 2 hours).
